NOTE: you will likely need to be on PHP 8.0 min for all of toolbox to work. I use toolbox as a testing ground as well for new php versions, so there could be things used here, that are only found in php 8.0+.

Toolbox For IPS
This app is created for the use to help with development with in IPS.

Branches:
XP: this branch would be "unstable", new features or major changes will be found in this branch, but they might not be completely implemented or have known bugs.
Dev: this would be the current "stable" branch, with bug fixes and "stable" features for the current version of IPS.
Master: this would be the branch that is "stable" at the start of every "minor" version of IPS EG ( 4.1,4.2,4.3,4.4 etc), this branch is often out of date and serves as a "reference". 

Code outlines:
I use PSR guidelines, I would expect any pull request to also be in PSR.

Code Of Conduct:
this might be ironic coming from me, but we can all strive to be better right? so in a world where you can be anything, be kind. that is it.
